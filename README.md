## Features

This project, developed during my internship, was my first dive into web development. Through building a React.js version of the Techno Solution website, I learned the essentials of responsive design and explored various effects like Swiper.js sliders. It's been a foundational experience, introducing me to key technologies and sparking my passion for creating engaging web experiences
